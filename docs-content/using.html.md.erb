This topic describes how to use GCP Stackdriver Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

With the nozzle deployed, you can view logs and metrics from PCF in [Stackdriver Logging](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/logs/viewer) and [Stackdriver Monitoring](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/monitoring). The logs and metrics available depend on the **Events to subscribe to** field that you set when [Configuring Stackdriver Nozzle for PCF](./installing.html#opsman-config).
