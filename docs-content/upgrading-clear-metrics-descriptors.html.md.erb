# Clearing Project Metric Descriptors

This procedure will delete all custom metric descriptors in your Stackdriver Monitoring project.
This results in historical data loss and the need to re-create dashboards.

## Prerequisites
- [Golang 1.9+](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [BOSH-CLI 2.0.48+](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html#install) (if using the `stackdriver-tools` BOSH release)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)

## 1. Authenticate with Google Cloud SDK
Authenticate with an account that has `roles/monitoring.admin` to the Stackdriver Monitoring project
and setup your application default credentials.

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth appliaction-default login
```

## 2. Fetch clear-metrics-descriptors source
```bash
go get -d github.com/cloudfoundry-community/stackdriver-tools/src/stackdriver-nozzle
```

## 3. Stop all instance of stackdriver-nozzle
All copies of the `stackdriver-nozzle` need to be completely stopped before proceeding. If an instance
is left running then old metric descriptors will be recreated.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/add-delete.html) to delete the
GCP Stackdriver Nozzle for PCF product from Operations Manager and apply changes to your deployment.

## 4. Clear Metric Descriptors
Enter the directory with the clear-metrics-descriptors tool:
```bash
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-community/stackdriver-tools/src/stackdriver-nozzle/cmd
```

Fill in your GCP Project in the following command and execute the tool:
```bash
go run ./clear-metrics-descriptors.go --project-id <your GCP project, eg cf-prod-logs>
```

Your project should now be clear of all custom metric descriptors. You can proceed with [installing](installing.html) the nozzle.
